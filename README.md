# 👋 Hi, I’m Shasank  

💡 Final-year Computer Science student | Assistant AI researcher (UoM) | Builder of experimental AI systems in games & beyond.  

🚀 Current focus:

- 🎮 Using Minecraft as a testbed for agentic AI and interactive systems  
- 🔍 Bridging research ideas (NLP, RL, knowledge systems) with real, playful applications  
- 🌌 Designing projects that mix creativity, logic, and a bit of imagination about the future  
- Working on a human-brain-inspired, private AGI project — less about size, more about structure.

> A Minecraft mod with pathfinding, NLP, reflexes, self-goals, and LLM-powered conversations.  

- [A free repository of free high quality custom made notes on the various subjects under Computer science](https://cse-engineering-notes.netlify.app/)
> A website where CS students can go and learn all they want to under the various suvjects of Computer Science. These are my personal custom made notes, made by scouring from resources all over the internet.
